Clear, Focused Interface: We'll create a new, separate page with a simple two-part input section:

Single Line Input: A text field specifically for the user to paste the one ads.txt line they want to check (e.g., google.com, pub-12345, DIRECT, f08c47fec0942fa0).

Website List Input: A larger textarea where the user can paste a list of domains, one per line.

Smart Scanning: The tool will automatically handle variations in user input, such as extra spaces or missing https:// prefixes on the domains. It will also retain the ads.txt/app-ads.txt toggle for flexibility.

Actionable Results Display: Instead of a single table, the results will be split into two clear, distinct lists:

"Found On": A list of all the sites where the specified line was successfully found.

"Not Found On / Error": A list of sites where the line was missing or where the ads.txt file could not be fetched (e.g., due to a 404 error).

Export Functionality: A "Download CSV" button will allow users to easily export the complete results, including the website and its corresponding status ("Found" or "Not Found"), for their records.
